# Generic Angular Bootstrap Modal

## Build from source

To build the package from source (for e.g. development), follow the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/one-acre-fund/generic-modal.git
cd generic-modal
npm i
gulp
```

The `gulp` command compiles the source files in `src` and pipes them to the `dist` directory. You shouldn't edit the files in `dist` directly, as they'll be overwritten when `gulp` is run.

## Try the demo

```
cd generic-modal
open index.html
```
