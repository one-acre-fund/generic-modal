# Generic Angular Bootstrap Modal

This is a package that extends the [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) modal. It configures the modal in a stylistically consistent way, while aiming to allow a high degree of flexibility.</p>

## Install
```
# install dependencies
$ npm i angular angular-ui-bootstrap bootstrap --save

# install the package
$ npm i generic-modal --save
```

## Build from source

To build the package from source (for e.g. development), follow the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/one-acre-fund/generic-modal.git
$ cd generic-modal
$ npm i
$ gulp
```

The `gulp` command compiles the source files in `src` and pipes them to the `dist` directory. You shouldn't edit the files in `dist` directly, as they'll be overwritten when `gulp` is run.

## Try the demo

```
$ cd generic-modal
$ open index.html
```
